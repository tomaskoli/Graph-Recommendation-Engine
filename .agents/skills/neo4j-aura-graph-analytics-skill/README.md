# neo4j-aura-graph-analytics-skill

Guides agents through **Aura Graph Analytics (AGA)** — Neo4j's serverless, on-demand GDS compute environment. Algorithms run in isolated ephemeral sessions billed per minute; no embedded GDS plugin required.

## What this skill covers

- Authentication with Aura API credentials (`GdsSessions`, `AuraAPICredentials.from_env()`)
- Memory estimation and `SessionMemory` tier selection
- Session creation, reconnection, listing, and deletion (`get_or_create`, TTL)
- Three data source modes: AuraDB-connected, self-managed Neo4j, standalone (Pandas/Spark)
- Remote graph projection (`gds.v2.graph.project(..., query)` with `gds.graph.project.remote()`)
- Python client v2 endpoint shape (`gds.v2.*`) without mixing camelCase/snake_case; v1 fallback when needed
- AuraDB Cypher API projection with `memory` or `sessionId`
- Standalone graph construction from DataFrames (`gds.v2.graph.construct()`)
- Algorithm execution: mutate / stream / write modes
- Async job polling pattern
- Result retrieval (`gds.v2.graph.node_properties.stream()`, `db_node_properties`)
- Write-back to connected Neo4j; cleanup before session deletion
- Common errors and mitigations (session expired, graph not projected, memory exceeded)
